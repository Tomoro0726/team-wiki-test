## Overview

We believe that it is **our responsibility** to understand and manage the risks that relate to our activities. Our team ensured that all involved in the wet lab activities understood **crucial biosafety rules**, such as cartagena laws and release beyond containment, as well as **precautions** needed when handling genetically modified organisms so that our actions do not lead to any potential harm to others or the environment. Not only that, we made certain that **all members,** regardless of lab participation, would know about **research ethics** before our activities began. Overall, it can be said that our team enjoyed these research activities while also keeping within the boundaries of iGEM Safety Rules and Policies.

### Chassis Safety 

We used E. coli DH5α for plasmid cloning, E. coli C600 for plasmid modification, B. subtilis 168 for conjugational transfer and B. subtilis natto BEST195 as the final chassis. All are classified under Risk Group 1, with B. subtilis especially considered GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) and B. subtilis natto regularly eaten for fermentation. Thus, all chassis in this study pose a low risk for humans and the community. During experiments, we followed the biosafety guidelines of our lab according to this biosafety level.

### Parts Safety

The aprE gene derives from B. subtilis natto, which is on the iGEM White List. The bacteria is also regularly applied as food, keeping its risks of handling fairly low.

### Lab Safety

Before starting any experiments, all members needed to be aware of biosafety protocols. We watched a video named “Genetically Modified Organisms Training Materials” that was distributed by Global Science Campus, a Japanese government-led research organization. Subsequently, after watching them each member had one-on-one meetings with our PI to have a two-way interaction to check our knowledge.   
While formulating our project, we all also read the book “BioBuilder: Synthetic Biology in the Lab” to further deepen our understanding about not only synthetic biology, but bioethics, its risks and engineering methods that can be utilized for safety.

As we begin our wet lab activities, we were given a document from the lab about the safety rules, how to use equipment, and how to proceed with our research.   
In addition, our lab advisors gave us extra rules to follow at the lab from time to time, thus we members held a group meeting by ourselves each time to go over the additional safety rules and fully understand it. The PI and advisors checked each one of us’ understanding and we were not allowed to experiment until we did.

Our team also kept a “Basic Lab Protocol” document, which included the error log. We made the basic lab protocol so that our use of lab tools went smoothly and we could minimize errors. Every time we used a new equipment, we made sure to record the process on this document so that others on the team can also be familiar. When we did make errors though, we made sure to write it in the error log so that we can learn from that mistake and not repeat it again. We all made sure to check the document frequently.

In addition, we created a platform on our Discord server where the wet lab participant of the day reported   
・Time  
・Experiments   
・Reflections  
・Next experiment  
everyday after wet lab activities. This kept the knowledge discrepancy between other non-participating members of the day fairly low, resulting to safer experiments where participants were aware of which stage of lab activity they were doing.
