        <span>Bats</span> play a large role in our culture and environment. They
        increase the biodiversity of local ecosystems and confer other economic benefits,
        such as saving the US billions of dollars on pest control annually.

            Thrombosis occurs when blood clots form in arteries and veins,
            clogging the flow. They can lead to other major problems, being
            responsible for 1 in 3 deaths in Japan, a serious concern in this
            aging society.

            Early-stage treatment drugs have heavy side effects, making healthy
            diets/exercises from a daily basis crucially important for
            prevention.
