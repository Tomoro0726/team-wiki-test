            <span>B. subtilis natto</span> is the bacteria that produces nattokinase
            during fermentation of soybeans. It is one of the highly consumed non-pathogenic,

              >not a widely used chassis</span
            >
            due to its poor natural genetic competence and lack of cloning methods.
