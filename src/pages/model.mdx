# Model
## Overview
Nattokinase (NK) produced by Bacillus subtilis subsp. natto (B. subtilis natto) is known to degrade fibrinogen in plasma. Based on this fact, a method called fibrinolysis assay is usually used to quantify NK[1]. This method is a technique in which a halo is formed by placing a culture medium containing NK on a fibrin sheet in a petri dish, and the NK activity can be visually confirmed by observing the size of the halo. However, the unit of FU is usually used to quantify NK activity, and to estimate FU from the visual size of the halo, it is necessary to conduct several experiments to obtain a reference curve. Moreover, this method is a statistical method, and it may be difficult to improve the curve when errors occur. Therefore, we developed a new mathematical model to estimate FU deterministically from the halo radius by fibrinolysis assay. This deterministic mathematical model is expected to provide explanatory power and facilitate the search for sources of error. Moreover, since our model can estimate FU at different concentrations once the biological parameters are determined, it is expected to minimize the experimenter's man-hours compared to the reference curve method.
Next, our team used NB medium (Nutrients Broth medium), which contains a large amount of amino acids, for the culture of B. subtilis natto. Although metabolic pathway analysis has been conducted in media containing Glucose and Glycerol, metabolism under NB medium has not been analyzed[2]. Since NB medium generally does not contain sugar, it is possible that amino acids in NB medium are directly utilized for NK production without moving metabolic pathways such as the glycolytic system. Therefore, we used Flux Balance Analysis to clarify the metabolic pathway by which B. subtilis natto produces NK in the NB medium. This study will provide a concrete understanding of the culture of B.subtilis natto in the NB medium, which has not been understood so far, and will make it possible to arrange the optimal medium for NK production in future studies.
## Our approach
We implemented two main types of modeling.
The first is an inverse prediction of NK concentration from the fibrin degradation radius in the Halo assay, which is commonly used for NK quantification, using partial differential equations. (FU Prediction section).
Second, to analyze the metabolic pathway through which B. subtilis natto produces NK in NB medium, we performed a simulation using Flux Balance Analysis. (Metabolism Analysis section)
### FU Prediction (Reaction-Porous Medium Equation Model)
Materials and Methods
First, we derived a partial differential equation for the relationship between NK and fibrin with two-dimensional space and time as variables by making the following assumptions and definitions based on previous studies ([3], [4]). Next, we estimated the parameters included in the partial differential equation based on experiments.
#### Derivation of equations
**Definition 1．**
\begin{gather}
\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E}(x, y, t) \\
u = u(x, y, t) \\
v = v(x, y, t)
\end{gather}
where $\mathcal{E}$ is the concentration of NK at a spatial point in the petri dish, $u$ is the concentration of the fibrin-NK action site before degradation, and $v$ is the concentration of the fibrin-NK action site after degradation. The degradation is assumed to be an irreversible reaction.

**Assumption 1．**
$u(x, y, 0) = \text{const.}$ that is, we assume that the time-initial value space of $u$ is uniform.

**Assumption 2.**
The action sites of NK on fibrin are as shown in the figure [Fig. 1], ...-[node]-[action site]-[node]-[action site]-[action site]-[node]-[action site]-.... [3], i.e., assuming that the action site exists as a “point” on the fibrin fiber, it is possible to reduce the discussion to a reaction kinetics discussion by focusing only on the action site. In other words, the law of mass action can be used.

Figure 1: Shows the action site of fibrin and NK, which are thought to be in a chain structure.

**Assumption 3．**
The $\mathcal{E}$ spreads in space by natural diffusion. The total amount of $\mathcal{E}$ in the petri dish is always constant because NK is not decomposed in the petri dish.

**Assumption 4.**
Fibrin shall retain its performance as a porous medium because of its fibrous form [4].

First, let's look at the diffusion term. Diffusion usually has the property of infinite propagation and is quickly distributed in space. However, since infinite propagation in a petri dish is unlikely, the diffusion term is described as diffusion in a porous medium using Assumption 4, rather than ordinary diffusion, to give it finite propagation.
The following is a series of partial differential equations with the reaction term represented by $g(x, y, t, u, v)$.
\begin{gather}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D(\mathcal{E}) \nabla \mathcal{E}) \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D(v) \nabla v) + g(x, y, t, u, v)
\end{gather}
However, $D(f)$ is the diffusion coefficient depending on any function $f$ and is expressed as $mf^{m-1}$ with constant $m > 1$ in the porous media equation.

The derivation of the reaction term follows. The reaction term is derived based on the Michaelis-Menten equation.
That is, we consider the case where the reaction occurs as follows.
\begin{gather}
\mathcal{E} + u \overset{k_{+1}}{\underset{k_{-1}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \mathcal{E} u \overset{k_{+2}}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{E} + v
\end{gather}
Here, to predict only the reaction term, we consider an ordinary differential equation with only time derivative. The concentrations of interest are $[\mathcal{E} u]$ (the complex concentration of $\mathcal{E}$ and $u$) and $v$.
\begin{gather}
\frac{d[\mathcal{E} u]}{dt} = k_{+1} \mathcal{E}u - (k_{-1} + k_{+2})[\mathcal{E} u] \\
\frac{dv}{dt} = k_{+2} [\mathcal{E} u]
\end{gather}
Assuming that $\mathcal{E} u$ is stationary, the first equation becomes $d[\mathcal{E} u]/dt=0$, and substituting the second equation, we obtain: 
\begin{gather}
\frac{dv}{dt} = V_{\text{max}} \frac{u}{K_M + u}
\end{gather}
However, $V_{\text{max}} \coloneq k_{+2} \mathcal{E}_T$, $K_M \coloneq \frac{k_{-1} + k_{+2}}{k_{+1}}$.
The following simultaneous partial differential equations are obtained from the above.
\begin{gather}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D(\mathcal{E}) \nabla \mathcal{E}) \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D(v) \nabla v) + V_{\text{max}} \frac{u}{K_M + u}
\end{gather}
### Parameter estimation
We developed a mathematical model to describe the degradation radius observed in the halo assay as a function of NK concentration. By fitting this model to experimental data, we estimated the parameters $m$, $V_\text{max}, and $K_M}, which are crucial for understanding the diffusion and reaction kinetics of NK in the fibrin gel. We used Python to calculate and visualize our model numerically.
#### Data Preparation
We started by converting the observed diameters from the halo assay into radii and storing the corresponding FU values. Since we did not have experimental data available, we referenced data from literature values[8].
```python
# Experimental data: FU and corresponding diameter (in cm)
FU_data = np.array([0, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50])
diameter_data = np.array([0, 0.55, 0.60, 0.70, 0.89, 1.21])

# Convert diameter to radius (in cm)
radius_data = diameter_data / 2
```
#### Model Prediction Function
We define a function to predict the degradation radius based on the model parameters and FU.
```python
# Define the model function to predict the radius
def predict_radius(FU, m, V_max, K_M):
    # Convert FU to initial NK concentration
    E0 = FU_to_concentration(FU)

    # Effective diffusion coefficient based on porous medium equation
    D_eff = m * E0 ** (m - 1)

    # Reaction term influenced by Michaelis-Menten kinetics
    alpha = V_max / (K_M + E0)

    # Predict radius (simplified model)
    R = np.sqrt((2 * D_eff * t) / alpha)
    return R
```
Mathematical explanation:
Effective Diffusion Coefficient: Incorporate the porous medium assumption to define an effective diffusion coefficient $D_\text{eff}$ dependent on $m$, where  $\mathcal{E}_0}$ is the initial concentration of NK.
\begin{gather}
D_\text{eff} = m \mathcal{E}_0^{m-1}
\end{gather}
Reaction Term: Derived from the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, influencing the parameter $\alpha$.
\begin{gather}
\alpha = \frac{V_\text{max}}{K_M + \mathcal{E}_0}
\end{gather}
Predicted Radius: $R$ where $t$ is the incubation time.
\begin{gather}
R = \sqrt{\frac{2D_\text{eff}\cdot t}{\alpha}} 
\end{gather}	
Conversion from FU to Concentration: Establish a calibration to convert FU to initial NK concentration $\mathcal{E}_0$. For this procedure, we assume a linear relationship. The conversion factor $k$ must be determined experimentally or based on
literature values.
\begin{gather}
\mathcal{E}_0 = k \times \text{FU}
\end{gather}
Objective Function
We define an objective function that computes the sum of squared errors between the observed radii and the radii predicted by the model. The goal is to minimize this error.
```python
# Objective function to minimize
def objective(params):
    m, V_max, K_M = params
    R_pred = predict_radius(FU_data, m, V_max, K_M)
    error = radius_data - R_pred
    return np.sum(error ** 2)
```
#### Optimization
Using the scipy.optimize.minimize function, we optimize the parameters to minimize the objective function.
```python
# Initial guesses for the parameters
initial_params = [1.5, 1e-3, 1e-6]

# Bounds for the parameters to ensure physical feasibility
bounds = [(1.0, 3.0),  # m > 1 for porous medium
          (1e-5, 1e-1),  # V_max positive
          (1e-8, 1e-4)]  # K_M positive

# Perform the optimization
result = minimize(objective, initial_params, bounds=bounds)

# Extract the estimated parameters
m_est, V_max_est, K_M_est = result.x
```
### FU Estimation
With the estimated parameters, we developed a method to estimate the FU of an unknown sample from the observed degradation radius. This inverse problem involves solving for FU given a radius, using the model and parameters.
#### Inverse Function for Estimation
We define a function to estimate FU from the observed radius by finding the root of the equation that equates the predicted radius to the observed radius.
```python
# Function to estimate FU from observed radius
def estimate_FU_from_radius(R_observed, m, V_max, K_M):
    # Define the function whose root we want to find
    def func(FU):
        R_pred = predict_radius(FU, m, V_max, K_M)
        return R_pred - R_observed

    # Set reasonable bounds for FU (e.g., 0 to 1000 FU)
    FU_min = 0
    FU_max = 1000

    # Use root-finding method
    try:
        FU_est = brentq(func, FU_min, FU_max)
    except ValueError:
        # If the function does not change sign in the interval, return NaN
        FU_est = np.nan
    return FU_est
```
We solve for FU in the equation:
\begin{gather}
\text{predicted_radius}(\text{FU}, \, m, \, V_\text{max}, \, K_M) - R_\text{observed} = 0
\end{gather}
#### Estimating FU for Each Observed Radius
We apply the estimation function to each observed radius.
```python
# Estimate FU for each observed radius
estimated_FU = []
for R_obs in radius_data:
    FU_est = estimate_FU_from_radius(R_obs, m_est, V_max_est, K_M_est)
    estimated_FU.append(FU_est)

estimated_FU = np.array(estimated_FU)
```
### Results
In this study, we successfully estimated parameters $m$, $V_\text{max}$, and $K_M$ governing the diffusion and reaction kinetics of NK in the fibrin gel using our mathematical model. Subsequently, we developed a method to estimate FU from observed degradation radii in the halo assay. 
Estimated Parameters
Using the provided experimental data and our diffusion-reaction model, we performed parameter estimation to determine the values of $m$, $V_\text{max}$, and $K_M$. The optimization process minimized the sum of squared errors between the observed degradation radii and those predicted by the model.

#### Estimated parameter values:
$m$ (Porous Medium Parameter): $1.056$
$V_\text{max}$ (Maximum Reaction Rate): $ 1.716 \times 10^{-3}$ mol/(L·h)
$K_M$ (Michaelis Constant): $1.348 \times 10^{-5}$ mol/L

The estimated parameters were used to predict the degradation radii corresponding to the experimental FU values. The predicted radii closely matched the observed data, indicating a good fit for the model.


Figure 2: Comparison between experimental degradation radii and model-predicted radii using the estimated parameters.

Performance Metrics: 
Sum of Squared Errors (SSE): $0.0002$ cm^2
Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$): $0.9989$
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $0.0047$ cm
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $0.0061$ cm
These metrics demonstrate the model accurately captures the relationship between FU and degradation radius, with an $R^2$ value indicating a high degree of correlation.

Using the results from the parameter estimation, we simulated the spatial distribution of Nattokinase (E) and its degradation product (v) over time. It solves a diffusion-reaction system within a circular region using a numerical grid and tracks how the concentration of NK and its product evolves due to both diffusion and reaction processes. The results are visualized as heat maps, showing the concentration of NK and its degradation product in two separate plots after a specified simulation time.

#### Estimated FU
With estimated parameters, we developed an inverse method to estimate FU from observed degradation radii. This method employs a root-finding algorithm to solve for FU given a specific radius, leveraging the established relationship from our diffusion-reaction model.

Applying the FU estimation method to the observed radii, yielded the following estimated FU values:

Figure 4: Scatter plot comparing actual FU values with those estimated from observed radii.

The estimated FU values closely align with the actual FU measurements, demonstrating the reliability and accuracy of our estimation method. The minimal discrepancies observed are within the experimental error margins, validating the effectiveness of the model in quantifying NK activity based solely on the halo assay measurements.

Statistical Summary:
Sum of Squared Errors (SSE): $5.3443$ FU^2
Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$): 0.9971
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $0.6776$ FU
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $0.9438$ FU
These statistics underscore the high precision of FU estimations derived from our model.

**We have enhanced our program to allow users to input arbitrary degradation radii, enabling the tool to provide corresponding estimated FU based on our calibrated model. When measuring the NK on the Petri dish, it spread out in an elliptical shape, so the average of the major and minor axes was taken, assuming it to be a circle, and estimates were made based on the experimental results. Estimated FU values are shown below[Fig.5].**


Figure 5: FU is estimated from the experimental data. The data were taken every 4 hours for 16hrs, 20hrs, and 24hrs.
### Discussion
By fitting our model to the experimental data, we obtained estimates for the parameters $m$, $V_\text{max}$, and $K_M$. These parameters provide insights into:
Diffusion Characteristics: The parameter $m$ relates to the diffusion of NK in the fibrin gel, considering the porous medium nature of the gel.
Enzymatic Activity: $V_\text{max}$ and $K_M$ are characteristic of the enzymatic reaction kinetics, representing the maximum reaction rate and the Michaelis constant, respectively.
The model’s predictions closely matched the experimental data, indicating that our assumptions and simplifications were reasonable for this system. 

Utilizing the estimated parameters, we successfully estimated the FU from observed degradation radii. The estimated FU values were in good agreement with the actual FU values, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in quantifying NK activity based solely on the halo assay measurements.

Although our calculations showed precision to a large extent, there are some assumptions and limitations we have to be aware of, which includes
Simplifications: The model simplifies the complex diffusion-reaction system to make the problems tractable.
Parameter Sensitivity: The accuracy of FU estimation depends on the precision of the estimated parameters. Sensitivity analysis may be necessary.
Conversion Factor: The relationship between FU and NK concentration requires calibration for accurate conversions.
## Metabolism analysis (Flux Balance Analysis)
### Materials and Methods
First, we obtained metabolic pathway data in SBML format for B.subtilis from AGORA[5] (filename: “Bacillus_subtilis_str_168.xml”). Flux Balance Analysis was performed using COBRApy [6]. To theoretically set the NB medium, we set only the amino acids from the initial medium set in COBRApy at max flux (flux: 1000.0) and set all other fluxes to 0.0 to simulate the NB medium. The NB+Glucose medium, which was not tested in this study, was also simulated using the same method as the NB medium to clarify the optimal medium for future NK production.
The following is the COBRApy code and procedure.
#### Reading AGORA data in COBRApy
```python
sbml_path = "Bacillus_subtilis_str_168.xml"
model = read_sbml_model(sbml_path)
```
#### Setting up the culture medium environment
Read AGORA data in COBRApy Because we want to implement NB medium in COBRApy, we rewrite the pre-defined medium environment so that 20 amino acids can be imported with the same Max and min values.
```python
mediums = model.medium

non_amino_acids = [Please check on our GitHub repository]
for key, value in mediums.items():
    for lis in non_amino_acids:
        if lis == key:
            mediums[key] = 0.0
        else:
            continue

# Check the output to identify the wrong amino acids

aa = 0
for v in mediums.values():
    if v != 0:
        aa += 1

model.medium = mediums
```
#### Add a Reaction to the read data to get all 20 NB medium-derived amino acids at once.
```python
# Set the new Reaction for NK output

NK_reaction = Reaction("NK_output")
NK_reaction.name = "NK_output"
NK_reaction.subsystem = "Pseudo production of NK"
NK_reaction.lower_bound = 0
NK_reaction.upper_bound = 1000

NK_reaction
```
#### Calculate the amino acid usage of each of the 20 amino acids from the amino acid sequence of NK [7], and assign Stoichiometric coefficients to the Reaction in 3.
```python
import collections

nk_aa = "This data from NCBI protein databank ABM97611.1"

c = dict(collections.Counter(nk_aa))

counted_dict = {}

for k, v in c.items():
    counted_dict[one_to_full_name[k]] = v
```
Add a Reaction to discharge NK from 4 Reactions
```python
nattokinase = Metabolite("Nattokinase", name="nattokinase", compartment="c")

metabolites_dict = {}
for k in counted_dict.keys():
    for i in range(len(model.metabolites)):
        if (k == model.metabolites[i].name) & (model.metabolites[i].compartment == "c"):
            metabolites_dict[model.metabolites[i]] = -int(counted_dict[k])

# Add the NK
metabolites_dict[nattokinase] = 1

NK_reaction.add_metabolites(metabolites_dict)
# print(metabolites_dict)
NK_reaction.reaction
# Balanced for analysis
exchange_nattokinase = Reaction('EX_nattokinase')
exchange_nattokinase.name = 'Exchange reaction for Nattokinase'
exchange_nattokinase.lower_bound = 0
exchange_nattokinase.upper_bound = 1000

exchange_nattokinase.add_metabolites({nattokinase: -1})

model.add_reactions([exchange_nattokinase])


model.add_reactions([NK_reaction])
```
#### Set the Reaction created in 5 to Objective.
```python
model.objective = "NK_output"
```
#### Perform Optimize, a COBRApy specification
```python
solution = model.optimize()
```
#### Set a threshold value of $10^{-6}$ and select only Reactions with higher flux
```python
fluxes = solution.fluxes
active_reactions = [reaction for reaction in model.reactions if abs(fluxes[reaction.id]) > 1e-6]

active_metabolites = set()
for reaction in active_reactions:
    active_metabolites.update(reaction.metabolites)

active_model = Model("Active_Model")
active_model.add_metabolites(active_metabolites)
active_model.add_reactions(active_reactions)
active_model.objective = model.objective

write_sbml_model(active_model, "active_model.xml")

print(active_model.summary())

active_subsystems = set()
for reaction in active_reactions:
    if reaction.subsystem:
        active_subsystems.add(reaction.subsystem)

print("Utilized Subsystem:")
for subsystem in active_subsystems:
    print(subsystem)
```
#### A version of NB+Glucose medium was also created for comparison using the same method as 1~8
### Results
#### Numerical data of FBA
First, the Flux and the number of Reaction pathways utilized in each medium are shown below: the Flux was 13.09 in the NB-only medium, suggesting that the Flux increased to 21.89 when Glucose was added to NB [Table 1]. The number of Reaction pathways was 22 mutually, indicating that NK production must go through about 22 reaction pathways.

Table 1: The flux of “NB only” was 13.09 and “NB+Glucose” was 21.89. Both “NB only” and “NB+Glucose” reaction numbers are the same. 
#### Pathway data of FBA
Then, we examined the specific differences in reaction pathways between the two media environments. First, among the 22 reaction pathways, four pathways were identified as 'Respiration', 'Glycerophospholipid metabolism', 'Fructose and mannose metabolism', and 'Unassigned' in the NB+Glucose medium, but not in the NB+Glucose medium [Table 2]. mannose metabolism', and 'Unassigned' [Table 2]. Among the 22 reaction pathways, the pathways that were passed through in the NB+Glucose medium but not in the NB medium were 'Pyrimidine synthesis', 'Sulfur metabolism', 'Pyrimidine catabolism', 'Methionine and cysteine metabolism' [Table 2]. 


NB+Glucose was not utilized:
Respiration
Glycerophosph-olipid metabolism
Fructose and mannose metabolism
Unassigned
NB was not utilized:
Pyrimidine synthesis
'Sulfur metabolism
Pyrimidine catabolism
Methionine and cysteine metabolism

Table 2: Unutilized pathway in each medium. 
### Discussion
The results suggest that flux was relatively higher in the NB+Glucose culture environment than in the NB-only culture environment. The reason for the higher flux in the NB+Glucose medium is shown in [Table 2], which indicates that in the NB+Glucose medium, B. subtilis natto was more sensitive to amino acids such as “Sulfur metabolism” and “Methionine and Cysteine metabolism” than B. subtilis natto. This may be because B.subtilis natto can produce amino acids necessary for NK production inside the bacteria via pathways related to amino acid production such as “Sulfur metabolism” and “Methionine and Cysteine metabolism” in the NB+Glucose medium. Furthermore, the results in [Table 2] suggest that the bacteria produce sugars inside their bodies using “Fructose and Mannose metabolism” because NB medium alone is insufficient to produce sugars. However, this pathway is known to be suppressed during NK production[2]. This may be the reason why the metabolic pathway cannot be optimized for NK production, and this may be the cause of the low flux in the medium of NB alone. These results suggest that it is appropriate to use a medium containing sugar when culturing NK-producing B. subtilis natto in the future.
